# Spotify Clone

NextJS was used on both the client and server sides to create a Spotify clone. I used Postgresql and Prisma ORM for the database. ChakraUI was used to construct the style's components.

# Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

First and foremost, you must have the Postgresql database. If you don't have one running locally, you may establish a Postgresql database using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres).

- Start with cloning this repo.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/mithatercan/nextjs-spotify-clone.git
```

- You should install the dependencies.

```bash
 npm install
 #or
 npm install --force
```

- You should create the ` .env` file to set the JWT secret and database URL variables.

```bash
  touch .env
```

- The .env file should look like this.

```env
  DATABASE_URL=
  SHADOW_DATABASE_URL=
  JWT_SECRET =
```

### Prisma ORM

You must have the prisma orm downloaded on your local machine. To download the prisma, check the guide [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart).

- Then you should run migrate the schemas to database

```bash
  npx prisma migrate deploy
```

- And finally you should seed the data.

```bash
  npx prisma db seed
```

### Final Step

After all these setup above. The app is ready to run.

```bash
 npm run dev
```

Default port is 3000. App will be running at localhost:3000
